# hrv_metrics
Calculates metrics from interbeat intervals (IBI) for heart rate variability analysis. 

The data processing uses functions from

https://github.com/AlexanderSouthan/pyPreprocessing
and
https://github.com/AlexanderSouthan/pyRegression

so those need to be available.
Additionally, Pandas, Numpy and Scipy are used.

Is in an early develpment stage, see the docstring for info about the metrics calculated.
