# hrv_metrics
Calculates metrics from interbeat intervals (IBI) for heart rate variability analysis. 

The data processing uses functions from
https://github.com/Snijderfrey/pyPreprocessing,
so that needs to be available. Additionally, Pandas, Numpy and Scipy are used.

Is in a very early develpment stage and only very limited metrics are calculated.
